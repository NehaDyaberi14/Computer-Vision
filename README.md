# Traffic Sign Recognition and Classification

This project implements a machine learning model for recognizing and classifying traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It utilizes the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset and applies preprocessing techniques such as image augmentation, resizing, and normalization to improve model performance.

## Features
- CNN-based classification for accurate recognition of traffic signs.
- Real-time processing for autonomous driving applications.
- Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Optimized image preprocessing for enhanced model training.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Matplotlib
